    <h2>The Prototype Property</h2>
    <div>
      When creating a class, you would normally add any default properties and methods to
      the class declaration. But what if you want to augment the class with extra methods
      and properties after it has been created? It turns out that you can still do this
      using theprototypeproperty of the class. This is particularly useful if you don't
      have access to the class declaration, but still want to add properties and methods
      to the class.
      <br />
      Check the console to see the example. Notice that there’s a reference to this.weapon
      in the prototype attack()method, and when the instance calls the attack()method, it
      uses the instance’s weapon property. This is because this in the prototype always
      refers to the instance that actually calls the method.
