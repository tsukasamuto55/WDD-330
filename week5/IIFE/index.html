      <p>
        An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that
        runs as soon as it is defined. The name IIFE is promoted by Ben Alman in his blog.
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          It is a design pattern which is also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous
          Function and contains two major parts:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the
            Grouping Operator (). This prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom
            as well as polluting the global scope.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression () through
            which the JavaScript engine will directly interpret the function.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
