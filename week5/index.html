        <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
        <ul class="custom-marker">
          <li>
            ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces more exceptions and
            warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features. This is due to the
            fact that strict mode considers coding practices that were previously accepted
            as just being 'poor style' as actual errors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not using strict mode is often referred to as 'sloppy mode' as itâ€™s forgiving
            of sloppy programming practices. Strict mode encourages a better quality of
            JavaScript to be written that befits a ninja programmer, so its use is
            recommended.
          </li>
          <li>
            ES6 introduced JavaScript modules. These are self-contained pieces of code
            that are in strict mode by default, so the'use strict'declaration is not
            required.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Linting Tools</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Linting tools such asJS Lint,JS Hint,andES Lintcan be used to test the quality
            of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode. They are designed to
            highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain
            if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented. I
            already installed ESLint into my VSCode. Refer to ESLint extension in VSCode.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Feature Detection</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use
            feature detection. This is done using anifstatement to check whether an object
            or method exists before trying to actually call the method. Feature detection
            guarantees that the method is only called if it actually exists and fails
            gracefully, without any exceptions being thrown, if the method doesn't exist.
