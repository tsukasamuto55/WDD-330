        <h2>Notes from Eloquent JavasScript</h2>
        <h3>Chapter 2 Program Structure</h3>
        <ul class="custom-marker">
          <li>
            Binding (Variable)name may include dollar signs ($) or underscores (_) but no
            other punctuation or special characters.
          </li>
          <li>Executing a function is called invoking, calling, or applying it.</li>
          <li>
            The braces can be used to group any number of statements into a single
            statement, called a block.
          </li>
          <li>
            A a do loop always executes its body at least once, and it starts testing
            whether it should stop only after that first execution.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is a special statement called break that has the effect of immediately
            jumping out of the enclosing loop.
          </li>
          <li>
            The continue keyword is similar to break, in that it influences the progress
            of a loop. When continue is encountered in a loop body, control jumps out of
            the body and continues with the loop’s next iteration.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chapter 3 Functions</h3>
        <ul class="custom-marker">
          <li>
            Each local scope can also see all the local scopes that contain it, and all
            scopes can see the global scope. This approach to binding visibility is called
            lexical scoping.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the function keyword is used at the start of a statement, it is called
            function declaration.
          </li>
          <li>
            A pure function is a specific kind of value-producing function that not only
            has no side effects but also doesn’t rely on side effects from other code—for
            example, it doesn’t read global bindings whose value might change.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chapter 4 Data Structures: Object and Arrays</h3>
        <ul class="custom-marker">
          <li>
            When using square brackets, the expression between the brackets is evaluated
            to get the property name. Whereas value.x fetches the property of value named
            “x”, value[x] tries to evaluate the expression x and uses the result,
            converted to a string, as the property name.
          </li>
          <li>
            The binary in operator, when applied to a string and an object, tells you
            whether that object has a property with that name.
          </li>
          <li>
            There’s an Object.assign function that copies all properties from one object
            into another. It could over write the initial value of the same key.
          </li>
          <li>
            The types of values discussed in earlier chapters, such as numbers, strings,
            and Booleans, are all immutable—it is impossible to change values of those
            types.
          </li>
          <li>
            Correlation is a measure of dependence between statistical variables.
            Correlation between variables is usually expressed as a value that ranges from
            -1 to 1. Zero correlation means the variables are not related. Negative one
            also means that the variables are perfectly related but that they are
            opposites
          </li>
          <li>
            Arrays have an includes method that checks whether a given value exists in the
            array.
          </li>
          <li>
            array.push() and array.pop(), which add and remove elements at the end of an
            array, earlier in this chapter. The corresponding methods for adding and
            removing things at the start of an array are called array.unshift() and
            array.shift().
          </li>
          <li>
            Both indexOf and lastIndexOf take an optional second argument that indicates
            where to start searching.
          </li>
          <li>
            The concat method can be used to glue arrays together to create a new array,
            similar to what the + operator does for strings.
          </li>
          <li>
            One difference is that a string’s indexOf can search for a string containing
            more than one character, whereas the corresponding array method looks only for
            a single element.
          </li>
          <li>
            The trim method removes whitespace (spaces, newlines, tabs, and similar
            characters) from the start and end of a string.
          </li>
          <li>
            The zeroPad function from the previous chapter also exists as a method. It is
            called padStart and takes the desired length and padding character as
            arguments.
          </li>
          A string can be repeated with the repeat method, which creates a new string
          containing multiple copies of the original string, glued together.
