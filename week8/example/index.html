    <h2>Transforms</h2>
    <p>
      I am going to show some examples of each type of transform. Please hover an object
      to see the change in action.
      <br />
      <b
        >**Transforms don’t work on inline elements. But that’s easy enough to fix. We’ll
        just add display: inline-block; to an element:</b
      >
    </p>

    <h3>Translation</h3>
    <p>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down.</p>
    <div class="example1"></div>

    <h3>Scaling</h3>
    <p>
      The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then
      vertically.
    </p>
    <div class="example2"></div>
    <p>
      Note that you shouldn’t declare a new transform: because of the cascade, a second
      transform would override the first. To declare multiple transformations, provide a
      space-separated list of transform functions. We simply add our scale to the end of
      that space-separated list.
    </p>
    <div class="example3"></div>
    <p>
      It’s also worth remembering that scaling, like translation, has no impact on the
      document flow. This means that if you scale inline-block elements, text around it
      will fail to accommodate it with reflowing.
    </p>

    <h3>Rotation</h3>
    <p>
      The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified
      angle value. As with scale, by default the point of origin is the element’s center.
      Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise
      and negative moving counterclockwis.
    </p>
    <div class="example4"></div>
    <div class="example5"></div>

    <h3>Skew</h3>
    <p>
      The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d expect, the
      x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. If
      the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis:
    </p>
    <div class="example6"></div>

    <h3>Changing of the Origin of the Transform</h3>
    <p>
      As we hinted at earlier, you can control the origin from which your transforms are
      applied. This is done using the transform-origin property. It has the same syntax as
      the background-position property, and defaults to the center of the object (so that
      scales and rotations will be around the center of the box by default).
    </p>
    <div class="example7"></div>

    <p>
      The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your
      translate direction will be on the rotated axis. See below examples to see the
      difference based on the order of transform functions.
    </p>
    <div class="example8"></div>
    <div class="example9"></div>

    <h3>Transition</h3>
    <p>
      Any property changing from one value to another for which you can find a valid
      midpoint can be transitioned. For example, in transitioning from a 1px red border to
      a 15px blue border, we transition the color and width of the border. The midpoint of
      1px and 15px is obvious (8px), so we know that is a transitionable property value.
      The midpoint between red and blue might not seem obvious, but the browser converts
      named colors to their numeric values, which have a midpoint. If the border-style
      were declared as changing from solid to dashed, that would not be a transitionable
      property as there is no midpoint between these key terms.

      <br /><br />
      It is important to include a pre-state and a post-state. For example, to transition
      from rectangular corners to rounded corners, set the original state to
      border-radius: 0;.

    </p>

    <h3>The transition-duration Property</h3>
    <p>
      200ms or .2s is generally considered the optimum time for a transition: anything
      slower will make the website seem slow, drawing generally unwanted attention to what
      was supposed to be a subtle effect. Anything faster may be too subtle.
    </p>

    <h3>The transition-timing-function Property</h3>
    <p>
      The most common timing functions include the key terms ease, linear, ease-in,
      ease-out, or ease-in-out. The default ease has a slow start, then it speeds up, and
      ends slowly. ease-in-out is similar to ease, but accelerates more sharply at the
      beginning. linear creates a transition that animates at a constant speed. ease-in
      creates a transition that is slow to start but gains speed, then stops abruptly. The
      opposite, ease-out, starts at full speed, then slows progressively as it reaches the
      conclusion of the transition.

      <br /><br />
      In addition to the predefined timing functions and developer-defined cubic Bézier
      function, you can divide the transition over equidistant steps. With the steps
      function, you define the number of steps and the direction of either start or end,
      where either the first step happens at the animation start, or the last step happens
      at the animation end respectively. For example, steps(5, start) would jump through
      the equidistant steps of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%, and steps(5, end) would jump
      throught the equidistant steps of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%.
    </p>

    <div class="ease-in-out">ease-in-out</div>

    <h3>Tip: Negative transition-delay</h3>
    <p>
      Interestingly, a negative time delay that’s less than the duration of the entire
      transition will cause it to start immediately, but it will start partway through the
      animation. For example, if you have a delay of -500ms on a 2s transition, the
      transition will start a quarter of the way through, and will last 1.5 seconds. On
      the way back, it will jump 75% of the way through the transition, and then
      transition back to the default state. This might be used to create some interesting
      effects, so it’s worth being aware of.
    </p>

    <div class="negative-delay">Negative Delay (-1s)</div>

    <h2>Animations</h2>
    <p>
      CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation
      via keyframes.

    <div class="appear-disappear"></div>
    <div class="bg-move"></div>

    <h3>The Shorthand animation Property</h3>
    <p>
      Fortunately, there’s a shorthand for all of these animation properties, especially
      since we’re still including the -webkit- prefix. The animation property takes as its
      value a space-separated list of values for the longhand animation-name,
      animation-duration, animation-timing-function, animation-delay,
      animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, animation-fill-mode, and
      animation-play-state properties:
