        <h2>Notes from JAVASCRIPT IN THE INDUSTRY (additional source I found)</h2>
        <h3>Imperative vs. declarative</h3>
        <ul class="custom-marker">
          <li>
            <b>Imperative</b> programming focuses on <b>how</b> you want something done.
            We alter the state of our program step by step.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Declarative</b> programming focuses on <b>What</b> the end result will be.
            How to obtain that result is less interesting, as long as the process of
            obtaining it does <b>not</b> alter the state of our program..
          </li>
          <li>
            When a function carries out a task in a deterministic way without changing its
            environment (changing state in its surroundings), it is called <b>pure</b>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example of an imperative style</h3>
        <div>There are few problems with this example</div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The function multiplyAll does not have a return value. Since it's not
            returning anything, it's not pure.
          </li>
          <li>
            The original <italic>listOfNumbers</italic>array gets <b>mutated</b>. The
            function alters of the input given as an argument, which means it's
            <b>not immutable.</b>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="image">
          <img
            src="images/imperative_style.png"
            alt="an example of an imperative style of coding"
          />
        </div>
        <h3>Example of an declarative style</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The function map has a return value. It doesn't change its surroundings and
            will return the same result every time, so map method is <b>pure.</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            The original <italic>listOfNumbers</italic>stays untouched. Map will create a
            new copy of the array for us, then alter it. Hence, it is <b>pure.</b>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="image">
          <img
            src="images/declarative_style.png"
            alt="an example of an declarative style of coding"
          />
        </div>

        <h3>Things to be aware of</h3>
        <ul class="custom-marker">
          <li>
            Be careful with
            <italic>push, shift, unshift, pop, reverse, splice, sort, and fill</italic
            >because those methods alter an ordinal array. Meaning, if we use them, our
            code becomes am imperative style. Hence, it's not <b>pure.</b>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Notes from the article "This in JavaScript"</h2>
        <h3>So, what is "this"?</h3>
        <div>
          There are six different ways where <code>this</code> can take on new values.
        </div>
        <ol>
          <li><code>this</code> in global context</li>
          <li><code>this</code> in object construction</li>
          <li><code>this</code> in an object method</li>
          <li><code>this</code> in a simple function</li>
          <li><code>this</code> in an arrow function</li>
          <li><code>this</code> in an even listener</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>This in a Global context</h3>
        <div>
          When <code>this</code> is called outside of any function, this defaults to the
          Window object in the browser. Usually, we wouldn't use <code>this</code> in a
          gloabl context.
        </div>
        <h3>This in object construction</h3>
        <div>
          when we create a new instance of an object with the new keyword, this refers to
          the instance.
        </div>
        <div class="image">
          <img
            src="images/this_in_object.png"
            alt="an example of this in object construction"
          />
        </div>
        <h3>This in a Object method</h3>
        <div>
          Since this refers to the object, we can use methods to get the instance of an
          object, like below.
        </div>
        <div class="image">
          <img
            src="images/this_in_object_method.png"
            alt="an example of this in object construction"
          />
        </div>
        <h3>This in a Simple function</h3>
        <div>
          We need to create a variable that stores the reference to the this. This
          variable is often called self or that.
        </div>
        <div class="image">
          <img
            src="images/this_in_simple_function.png"
            alt="an example of this in object construction"
          />
        </div>
        <h3>This in am arrow function</h3>
        <div>
          this in an arrow function is always the same as this around it (in its immediate
          scope.)<br />
          With arrow functions, the speakLeet example could be written in the following
          way:
        </div>
        <div class="image">
          <img
            src="images/this_in_arrow_function.png"
            alt="an example of this in object construction"
          />
        </div>
        <h3>This in Event Listeners</h3>
        <div>this is set to the element that fired the event in an event listener:</div>
      </div>
    </main>
