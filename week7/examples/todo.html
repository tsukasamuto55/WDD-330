    <form id='todo' action='https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos' method='POST'>        
        <input type='text' name='task'  placeholder='Add Task' autofocus required>        
        <button type='submit'>Add Task</button>    
    </form>    
    <p>This code creates an event listener that first of all prevents the default behavior of the form, so it doesn't get submitted when the Add Task button is clicked. Next it creates a task object with a title property that is taken from what was entered in the form. It also has a completed property that has a default value of false. This object is then transformed into a JSON string using the JSON.stringify method and assigned to the variable data.
    <br><br>
    After this, we build the Headers and Request objects. Because we are sending JSON, we need to add headers of 'Accept': 'application/json' and 'Content-Type': 'application/json'. Because we are sending data, we need to ensure that the method property of the request object is POST so that a POST request is used to send the data. The most important property of the request object is body – this is where the data we want to send is placed. We use the data variable here, so that JSON is sent to the server.
    <br><br>
    Then we use the fetch() method to send the request and deal with the response. This creates a promise that resolves to a JSON object, so we use the json() method to create another promise that resolves to a JavaScript object. This object has a single property of id to mimic successfully saving the task to a database (as this would result in it being assigned an ID by the database).
    <br><br>
    This fakes the fact that the task has been saved to a database and the relevant data has been returned. In reality, the data hasn’t been saved, and the ID property has just been randomly generated for demonstration purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Fetch API includes the FormData interface, which makes it much easier to submit information in forms using Ajax.
    A FormData instance is created using a constructor function:
    <br><br>
    If a form is passed to this constructor function as an argument, the form data instance will serialize all the data automatically, ready to be sent using Ajax. In our last example, we created the task manually based on the data provided in the form. The FormData interface helps to reduce the amount of code needed when submitting forms.
    </p>
    <img src="../pics/formData.png" alt="example of formData">
    <p>In this function, we create a new FormData instance using the FormData() constructor function and provide the form as an argument. This does all the hard work of creating the task object for us.

        It’s also possible to add data to the form data instance as key-value pairs using the append() method:</p>
    <script>
        const form = document.forms['todo'];
        form.addEventListener('submit', addTask, false);

        function addTask(event) {
            event.preventDefault();
            const number = form.task.value;
            const task = {
                userId: 1,
                title: form.task.value,
                completed: false
            }
            const data = JSON.stringify(task);
            const url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos'; 

            const headers = new Headers({
                'Accept': 'application/json',
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            })
        const request = new Request(url,{
            method: 'POST',
            header: headers,
            body: data
        }
        )

        fetch(request)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(task => console.log(`Task saved with an id of ${task.id}`))
        .catch(error => console.log(`There was an error:`, error))
        }
